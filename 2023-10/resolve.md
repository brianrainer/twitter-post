Last month, the benevolent algorithm gods spare me with the wisdom and opportunity to watch a video that is going to change my mind and shift my paradigm forever. It was a video by Dr.K's famous twitch streamer and clinical psychologist's channel called @.healthygamergg.

The first time I watched it I realize so many things about my life, and what I can change. The whole world must know this! I thought. I shared my findings with my sisters, my brother, my friends, and even acquintances I just met. It's that mind-blowing (to me).

If you have 20 minutes I highly recommend watching it, and even if you only have 10 minutes, you can watch it with 2x speed and it's still going to be worth it.

Anyway, the video is called: Discipline is actually an Emotion

[insert the video thumbnail]

It's a silly title for a video, we know that discipline is not an emotion, so that's why I clicked it. 

Dr.K opens with sharing that modern neuroscience don't actually understand emotion as well as we thought.

In his observation, addicts need discipline. However in numerous rehabs like AA, instead of teaching discipline, addicts are actually given the platform and opportunity to talk about their *feelings*. This is the first observation.

Rehabs work, so there is actually merit in talking about *feelings*.
